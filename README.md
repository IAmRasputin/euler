ProjectEuler
============

A collection of my solutions to the mathematical problems posed by 
ProjectEuler.net, as a demonstration of my programming ability.

If you are currently working on your own Project Euler problems...

DO NOT PROCEED
SERIOUSLY
GO AWAY
NO CHEATING

This code is intended as a demonstration that I can, in fact, program.  Not for 
you to cheat with.  Besides, what's the fun in that?
